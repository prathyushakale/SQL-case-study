Use Case Domain: Health
Overview:
A healthcare organization wants to build a database to manage patient data and improve healthcare outcomes. The database will be used to store and manage patient information, such as medical history, lab results, and prescriptions. The organization also wants to use the database to track patient outcomes, such as readmission rates and medication adherence.

Solution:
The healthcare organization will build an SQL database to store and manage patient data. The database will be designed to allow healthcare providers to access and update patient information in real-time. The database will also be designed to provide analytics on patient outcomes.

Data Model:
The data model will include the following tables:

Patient Table: This table will store patient demographic information, such as name, address, date of birth, and contact information.

Medical History Table: This table will store patient medical history, including diagnoses, treatments, surgeries, and medications..

Lab Results Table: This table will store patient lab results, including blood tests, urine tests, and imaging tests.

Prescriptions Table: This table will store patient prescription information, including medication. name, dosage, and frequency.

Prescriptions Table: This table will store patient prescription information, including medication. name, dosage, and frequency.

Outcome Table: This table will store patient outcome information, such as readmission rates and medication adherence.

Data Flow:
The following data flow will be implemented:

Patient data will be entered into the database when a new patient is registered.

Healthcare providers will access patient information through a web-based interface, which

will query the database in real-time.

Healthcare providers will update patient information through the web-based interface, which

will write updates back to the database in real-time.

The database will be used to generate analytics on patient outcomes, which will be displayed

through a dashboard interface.

Data Security:
The database will be designed with data security in mind. The following measures will be

implemented to ensure data security.

All patient data will be encrypted in transit and at rest.

Access to patient data will be restricted to authorized healthcare providers.

Access to the database will be logged and monitored to detect unauthorized access.

Data backups will be taken regularly to ensure data availability in the event of a disaster.

Conclusion:
An SQL database can be used to manage patient data and improve healthcare outcomes. The database can be designed to allow healthcare providers to access and update patient information in real-time. The database can also be designed to provide analytics on patient outcomes, which can be used to improve patient care. Data security measures must be implemented to ensure patient data is protected.

Use Case Domain: Library Management System
The library management system is a domain that involves managing library resources such as books, journals, and magazines, as well as managing the borrowing and returning of these resources by library patrons. The primary use case of a library management system is to provide a centralized system to manage and organize the library's collection, as well as facilitate the borrowing and returning of resources by library patrons.

The library management system will have several stakeholders, including the library staff, library patrons, and administrators who oversee the library's operations. The system will need to provide different levels of access to these stakeholders, with library staff having full access to the system's features, patrons having access to a limited set of features, and administrators having access to all features.

DATABASE DESIGN:
The database design for the library management system will consist of several tables to store data related to the library's collection, borrowers, loans, and reservations.

BOOKS TABLE:
The books table will store information about each book in the library's collection. The table will have the following fields:

BookID: Unique identifier for each book

Title: Title of the book

Author: Name of the book's author

Publisher: Name of the book's publisher

Publication Year: Year the book was published

ISBN: International Standard Book Number for the book

Genre: The genre of the book

Availability: Boolean value indicating whether the book is available for borrowing or not

4 BORROWERS TABLE: The borrower's table will store information about library patrons who have borrowed books. The table will have the following fields:

BorrowerID: Unique identifier for each borrower

*Name: Name of the borrower

Address: Address of the borrower

Phone Number: The phone number of the borrower

Email: Email address of the borrower

LOANS TABLE:
The loans table will store information about books that have been borrowed by library patrons. The table will have the following fields:

LoanID: Unique identifier for each loan

BookID: Identifier for the book being borrowed

BorrowerID: Identifier for the borrower who is borrowing the book

Date Borrowed: The date the book was borrowed

Due Date: The date the book is due to be returned

Date Returned: Date the book was returned (NULL if the book has not yet been returned)

RESERVATIONS TABLE:
The reservations table will store information about books that have been reserved by library patrons. The table will have the following fields:

ReservationID: Unique identifier for each reservation

BookID: Identifier for the book being reserved

BorrowerID: Identifier for the borrower who is reserving the book

Date Reserved: The date the book was reserved

*Date Needed:*The date the book is needed by the borrower

Status: Status of the reservation (active, canceled, or expired)

QUERYING THE DATABASE:
To retrieve information from the database, various SQL queries can be used. Here are some

examples:

Get all available books:
SELECT FROM Books WHERE Availability = 1;

Get all borrowed books:
SELECT Books.Title, Books,Author, Borrowers.Name, Loans.DateBorrowed, Loans.DueDate

FROM Books

INNER JOIN Loans ON Books.BookID= Loans.BookID

INNER JOIN Borrowers ON Loans.BorrowerID= Borrowers.BorrowerID;

Get all reserved books:
SELECT Books.Title, Books.Author, Borrowers.Name, Reservations.DateReserved, Reservations.DateNeeded

FROM Books

INNER JOIN Reservations ON Books.BookID = Reservations.BookID;
